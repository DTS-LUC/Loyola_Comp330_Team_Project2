Jacob Wrestles at #Peniel
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
Jabbok.
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
that he had.
And @Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until
the #breaking-of-the-day.
